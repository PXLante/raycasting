# RayCaster

## Background
This project was to set up a DOOM-like raycasting engine with simple collisions. I wanted to set this up to get some practice with my C and math chops, and I turned out quite happy with the end result. 


## setup
This project was ran using the DevC++ IDE. Additional configuration is required to set up OpenGL. Download necessary headerfiles and config from

http://chortle.ccsu.edu/Bloodshed/glutming.zip

Put glut.h in        Dev-Cpp\MinGW32\include\GL  
Put libglut32.a in   Dev-Cpp\MinGW32\lib  
Put glut32.dll in    C:\\Windows\SysWOW64

## to run
The main file is raycaster.c

Compile and run to see the Ray Tracing work.
